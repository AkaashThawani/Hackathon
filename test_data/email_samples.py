        Hi there, thanks for the quick reply.

        Okay, let's go with 30 of the Yellow Devices.

        Wait, my manager just told me to change that. Sorry! Please make it 25 of the Yellow Devices instead. And can you add a dozen of the 2m USB cables to that?

        Deliver to Fast Movers Depot, 42 Desert Road, Phoenix, AZ 85001. Needs to be here EOD Friday.

        Thanks for your flexibility!
